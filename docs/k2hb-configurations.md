# Configuration

There are a number of environment variables that can be used to configure
the system. Some of them are for configuring Kafka2Hbase itself, and some
are for configuring the built-in ACM PCA client to perform mutual auth.

## Kafka2Hbase Configuration

#### Hbase

By default Kafka2Hbase will connect to Zookeeper at `zookeeper:2181` use the parent uri `hbase`
and create tables in the `k2hb` namespace. The data will be stored in `cf:data`
with at least `1` version and at most `10` versions and a TTL of 10 days.

* **K2HB_HBASE_ZOOKEEPER_PARENT**
    The hbase parent uri, defaults to `/hbase` but should be set to `/hbase-unsecure` for AWS HBase
* **K2HB_HBASE_ZOOKEEPER_QUORUM**
    Comma separated list of Zookeeper servers
* **K2HB_HBASE_ZOOKEEPER_PORT**
    The listening port of the Zookeeper servers
* **K2HB_HBASE_DATA_TABLE**
    The name of the table to store message bodies in
* **K2HB_HBASE_DATA_FAMILY**
    The name of the column family to store message bodies in
* **K2HB_HBASE_TOPIC_TABLE**
    The name of the table to store topic message counts in
* **K2HB_HBASE_TOPIC_FAMILY**
    The name of the column family to store topic message counts in
* **K2HB_HBASE_TOPIC_QUALIFIER**
    The name of the column qualifier to store topic message counts in
* **K2HB_HBASE_BYPASS_TOPICS** (optional)
  When set to a valid regex, the name of the HBase table (which is formatted differently to the Kafka topic) will be evaluated against this regex. Tables that match will not have any records written to HBase, but S3 and manifest writing will continue. To prevent all tables being written to HBase, set this to .* which will match all table names.

#### Kafka

By default Kafka2Hbase will connect to Kafka at `kafka:9092` in the `k2hb`
consumer group. It will poll the `test-topic` topic with a poll timeout of
`10` days, and refresh the topics list every 10 seconds (`10000` ms).

* **K2HB_KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS**
    Comma separated list of Kafka servers and ports
* **K2HB_KAFKA_CONSUMER_GROUP**
    The name of the consumer group to join
* **K2HB_KAFKA_TOPIC_REGEX**
    A regex that will fetch a list of topics to listen to, e.g. `db.*`. Defaults to `test-topic.*`
* **K2HB_KAFKA_META_REFRESH_MS** (Optional)
    The frequency that the consumer will ask the broker for metadata updates, which also checks for new topics.
    Defaults to `10000` ms (10 seconds).
    Typically, should be an order of magnitude less than `K2HB_KAFKA_POLL_TIMEOUT`, else new topics will not be discovered within each polling interval.
* **K2HB_KAFKA_POLL_TIMEOUT**
    The maximum time to wait for messages in ISO-8601 duration format (e.g. `PT10S`).
    Defaults to 1 Hour.
    Should be greater than `K2HB_KAFKA_META_REFRESH_MS`, else new topics will not be discovered within each polling interval.
* **K2HB_KAFKA_INSECURE**
    Disable SSL entirely (useful for dev / test) with `K2HB_KAFKA_INSECURE=true`
* **K2HB_KAFKA_CERT_MODE**
    If SSL is enabled, either create certs in ACM-PCA with value `CERTGEN` or retrieve
    them from ACM with value `RETRIEVE`
* **K2HB_KAFKA_FETCH_MIN_BYTES** (Optional)
    The minimum number of bytes read from a topic, unless the max wait timeout is encountered. Default: 1
* **K2HB_KAFKA_FETCH_MAX_WAIT_MS** (Optional)
    Limits the wait when K2HB_KAFKA_FETCH_MIN_BYTES is set
* **K2HB_KAFKA_MAX_FETCH_BYTES** (Optional)
    The maximum amount of data the server should return for a fetch request. Default: 100,000,000
* **K2HB_KAFKA_MAX_PARTITION_FETCH_BYTES** (Optional)
    The maximum amount of data per-partition the server will return. Default: 100,000,000
* **K2HB_KAFKA_CONSUMER_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS** (Optional)
    The maximum amount of time the client will wait before it assumes a request to the kafka broker has failed. Default: 30_000



#### SSL Mutual Authentication (CERTGEN mode)

configured in full or disabled entirely via `K2HB_KAFKA_INSECURE=FALSE`
